# Available Data Sets

Use the `listDatasets` function to view currently available data sets and the names of their accessor functions. Help pages fot particular accessors contain more information on their data sets.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(scMultiome)
listDatasets()
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
lds <- listDatasets()
knitr::kable(lds, caption = "Available Data Sets")
```

Access a data set by calling its accessor function:
```{r eval = FALSE}
prostateENZ()
```


See the help files for accessor functions for possible extra options, e.g. `?prostateENZ`.

# Transcription Factor Binding Motifs

The package contains an additional data set that contains information on transcription factor binding. This is not multiome data but compiled ChIP-seq data that can be used together with multiomes to compute epiregulons. It exists in three varieties, depending on the genome used to build the data. Currently supported genomes are: Hg38, Hg19, and Mm10.

Like multiome data, the ChIP-seq data is packaged into a hdf5 file and can be accessed with the accessor function `tfBinding`. Unlike multiome data, only one subset can be retrieved at a time, a genome must be specified.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
tfBinding("hg38")
```
