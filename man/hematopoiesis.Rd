\description{
Example scATAC-seq data of hematopoietic cells included in ArchR package was integrated with scRNAseq. ScATAC-seq data was obtained from GSE139369 and scRNA-seq obtained from https://jeffgranja.s3.amazonaws.com/ArchR/TestData/scRNA-Hematopoiesis-Granja-2019.rds

\section{Data storage and access}{

The \code{MultiAssayExperiments} is split into separate \code{SingleCellExperiment}
objects and they in turn are split into components, all of which are stored in a
single hdf5 file. Data and can be accessed with a special function that extracts
elements of the requested experiment(s), reassembles them, and builds an MAE.
