#### 1. Data download
Data sets were downloaded from https://github.com/GreenleafLab/chromVARmotifs/raw/master/data/ and format was changed to rds.

#### 2. Data preparation
The motifs were curated from the cisBP database. Position frequency matrices were converted to PWMs by taking the log of the frequencies (after adding a pseudocount of 0.008) divided by 0.25.

#### 3. Session information

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
